* Description*:
       As part of my internship at Codtech IT Solutions, Task-4 involved designing and implementing an AI-based recommendation system using Java programming and libraries like Apache Mahout. The goal was to develop a program that could suggest relevant products or content to users based on their preferences. This task allowed me to explore the logic and techniques behind recommendation systems, which are commonly used in platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube.
To begin, I researched Apache Mahout, which is an open-source library designed to create scalable machine learning algorithms, including recommendation engines. I attempted to integrate Apache Mahout 0.9, which supports collaborative filtering and works with CSV datasets to produce recommendations based on user-item relationships. However, I faced several technical issues during implementation. The Mahout libraries were outdated and difficult to configure in the current Eclipse environment. Many class imports such as DataModel, UserSimilarity, and GenericUserBasedRecommender were not recognized even after adding the JAR files. I spent a significant amount of time trying to resolve these issues, including updating project build paths and checking file structures, but the errors persisted.Since the library-based approach wasnâ€™t compiling successfully, I decided to create a simplified version of a recommendation system using core Java. This included importing a dataset in .csv format that contained user preferences in the form of numeric ratings. I used Java's File and Scanner classes to read the CSV file, storing the data in arrays and lists for processing. The program calculates basic similarity between users and generates recommendations by comparing their item preferences. While it does not use advanced machine learning algorithms, this basic logic simulates the working of a user-based collaborative filtering system.Through this task, I learned multiple technical concepts and practical skills. I improved my understanding of file handling, array manipulation, nested loops, and condition checks in Java. I also learned how to model recommendation logic manually without relying solely on external libraries. More importantly, I understood how AI-driven systems work behind the scenes, focusing on how user behavior and preferences can be used to make intelligent suggestions.Additionally, I experienced how to troubleshoot technical problems related to dependencies, file paths, and library conflicts. I learned to explore alternative solutions when a preferred tool does not work as expected. This helped improve my problem-solving mindset and adaptability.The output of my final program successfully takes a user ID, reads the preference matrix from the CSV file, and returns a list of recommended items. I also documented the process and uploaded all related files to GitHub as part of my submission. Despite the challenges with Apache Mahout, I was able to achieve the primary objective using Java.
